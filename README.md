Implement a solver for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_
salesman_problem) using one of the metaheuristic search algorithms (e.g., Hill Climbing Search, Simulated
Annealing Search, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithm) that are discussed in the lectures or an algorithm that
you research yourself and are interested to use. If you are unsure about your choice of algorithm, you can
check your algorithm with me before implementing it
